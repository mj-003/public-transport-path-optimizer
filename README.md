# Public Transport Path Optimizer
This repository contains an implementation of various path optimization algorithms for the public transport network of Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. It uses actual public transport schedule data to find optimal routes based on different criteria.

## Features

- Find the shortest path between two stops using:
  - Dijkstra's algorithm (time optimization)
  - A* algorithm (time optimization with heuristics)
  - A* for minimizing transfers
  - Advanced A* with multi-criteria optimization
- Find the optimal route that visits multiple stops using Tabu Search
- Visualize routes on an interactive map
